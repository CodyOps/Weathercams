# Weathercams

In our first group project, we were tasked with creating an application culminating all of the skill that we have learned so far in the foundations of our course. Our group wanted to create an application that solved the problem of a weather hub where users and travelers could get live and up to date weather information in a polished user application. In addition to the current weather conditions and a five day forecast, our application would feature live weathercam footage showcasing current weather conditions in a visual format of the user's searched cities. This application is world-wide, meaning that cities searched are not limited to the United States.

This application is: - Interactive. - Uses two different server side APIs. - Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts. - Use client-side storage to store persistent data. - Responsive. - Has a polished user interface.

Technologies used: - Ajax - Third Party APIs - GitHub Collaboration - JavaScript - JQuery - Local Storage

Directions for future development: - Radar weather - Allergan information and index - Interactive maps - More webcams availible to users - Current news and breaking weather conditions - Stored history webcams
